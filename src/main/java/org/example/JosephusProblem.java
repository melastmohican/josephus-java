 * Josephus problem is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game.
 * People are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified direction.
 * After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person,
 * going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains, and is freed.
